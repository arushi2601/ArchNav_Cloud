This project provides a containerized setup of the ArchNav application, consisting of multiple components including MySQL, ApacheDS (LDAP), Tomcat (Fortress), and GlassFish (ADF-enabled EAR deployment). 
The system has been migrated from a manual local installation to a fully Docker-based architecture, simulating a cloud-ready design.
